### 1. Description

**A comparative study between three neuronal models on Ex Vivo, Intracellular, Electrophysiological Datasets** is the dissertation for a MSc in Computer Science (Conversion).

The code included is a sample used for the project. Some edits and updates have been made since submission.

This study simulates voltage traces, and compares three neuronal models:

- Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)
- Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx)
- Hodgkin-Huxley (HH)

The following stimulus types were explored:

1. Short Square: Triple
2. Long Square
3. Ramp

Each model was evaluated with each stimulus type as collections of sweeps, and as an
individual sweep, and measured against the ex vivo sample.

The means of assessments included:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE) scores
- Matches for first and last spikes
- The number spikes produced
- Spike time matches with the target trace

All experiments were subjected to at least two tests to assess the variance in numerical results and visual traces.
Where results did not match expectations or were too varied to reach a definitive conclusion, further experiments were run.
